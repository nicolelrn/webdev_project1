    <h2>Hi, I'm Nicole!</h2>
    <p>Iâ€™m a student just getting started with web development, eager to learn and build my skills.</p>
    <p>I'm currently taking the <strong>Fundamentals of Web Development</strong> course by <strong>Illinois Tech</strong> through <strong><a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/illinois-tech-fundamentals-of-web-development">Coursera</a></strong>.</p>
    <h3>Education</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>High School</li>
      <li>Bachelor's Degree (<em>Expected Year of Graduation: 202x</em>)</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Certificates</h3>
    <p>None at the moment.</p>
    <h3>Current Learning Goals:</h3>
    <p>Before I began learning web development, I enjoyed conceptualizing website designs and creating my own versions of existing sites. I recently started learning web development because I want to bring those ideas to life, making fully functional websites with my own abilities.</p>
    <p>Right now, I'm currently learning:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>HTML and CSS basics</li>
      <li>Javascript basics</li>
      <li>Git/Github</li>
    </ul>
